# Melodic Muse: AI Music Generation Script

Welcome to Melodic Muse, an experimental AI music generation script that leverages unconventional techniques to inspire new sounds and push the boundaries of digital music creation. This project is open-source and encourages collaboration to explore the vast possibilities of AI in music.

## Features

- **Non-Traditional Techniques**: Utilizes a variety of methods beyond standard deep learning, including:
  - Rule-based systems
  - Procedural generation
  - Genetic algorithms
  - Sound synthesis from raw waveforms

- **Customization**: Easily tweak parameters to experiment with different sounds and styles.

- **MIDI Output**: Generates standard MIDI files, compatible with most music software.

- **Collaboration**: Open to contributions to enhance and expand the script's capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or newer
- Required libraries: NumPy, PySoundFile, Mido (Ensure all dependencies are installed from the `requirements.txt` file)

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the script from the command line by specifying the technique, optional mood, and output file name:

```bash
python melodic_muse.py --technique procedural --mood upbeat --output my_song.midi
```

Explore other command-line options to customize the generation process further.

## How is This Unique?

Melodic Muse is not just another AI music tool. It focuses on:
- **Expressive Range**: Producing unpredictable and surprising musical outputs.
- **Exploration Over Imitation**: Aiming to discover new sonic possibilities rather than recreating familiar sounds.

## Contributing

We are excited to collaborate with developers and musicians who are passionate about exploring the unconventional side of AI music generation. Hereâ€™s how you can contribute:
- Suggest new techniques or improvements.
- Add code implementations for different music generation methods.
- Share your unique creations made with Melodic Muse.
