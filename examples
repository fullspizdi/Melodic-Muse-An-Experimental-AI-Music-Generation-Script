# This directory is intended to store example MIDI files and sound samples generated by the Melodic Muse project.
# These files serve as demonstrations of the diverse capabilities of the music generation techniques implemented in the project.

# The examples included here are generated using different techniques such as rule-based systems, procedural generation, genetic algorithms, and sound synthesis.
# Each file is named according to the technique used and the mood or other parameters specified during generation.

# Example files:
# 1. rule_based_happy.midi - A MIDI file generated using the rule-based system with a happy mood setting.
# 2. procedural_upbeat.midi - A MIDI file created with procedural generation techniques with an upbeat mood.
# 3. genetic_algorithm_sad.midi - A MIDI file produced through a genetic algorithm reflecting a sad mood.
# 4. sound_synthesis_waveform.wav - A sound file generated from raw waveforms using sound synthesis.

# These files are for demonstration purposes and can be used as references or starting points for further experimentation and development of the Melodic Muse project.
